# Connect4

is a JQuery Plugin for a canvas element which turns it into a Connect4 game. (School project from June 2017)

```javascript
/* Select your canvas by Id
 If no object is given to the p4 function it will use the following params as defaults :

{
    color_player: {
        p1: "red",
        p2: "yellow"
    },
    size: {
        0: 10,
        1: 10,
        width: 800,
        height: 500
    },
    man: {
        0: true
    }
}

*/
